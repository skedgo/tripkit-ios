/// This protocol provides a set of methods that external types can use
/// to specify how certain events originated from TripKitUI are tracked.
///
/// Many TripKitUI types have an `eventTrackingDelegate` which is of type
/// `TKUIEventTrackable`. An example usage is thus for an external type
/// to conform to `TKUIEventTrackable` and assign itself to this delegate.
/// When trackable events are triggered, the delegate will be notified to
/// execute any custom tracking actions.
///
/// Note, it's not necessary for conforming types to implement all the
/// protocol methods. However, the default implementation for all methods
/// does nothing.
