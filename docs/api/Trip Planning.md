TripKit's trip planning capabilities provide wrappers around SkedGo's routing APIs, parsing and caching the results, and encapsulating the logic for dealing with regions and available modes.

Refer to the following classes:

- For A-to-B multi-modal routing: `TKBuzzRouter`
- Routing with waypoints: `TKWaypointRouter`
- Real-time updates: `TKBuzzRealTime`
