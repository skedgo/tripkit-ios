# ``TripKitInterApp``

Framework for inter-application communication and trip sharing functionality.

## Overview

TripKitInterApp provides capabilities for sharing trip information between applications, handling deep links, and managing inter-app communication workflows. This framework enables seamless integration between transportation apps and external applications through standardized protocols and data sharing mechanisms.

The framework handles URL schemes, universal links, trip sharing protocols, and provides utilities for exporting and importing trip data across application boundaries.

## Topics

### Inter-App Communication

Core components for handling communication between applications.

### Trip Sharing

Components for sharing trip information with external applications.

### URL Handling

Utilities for processing deep links and universal links related to trip data.

### Data Export

Tools for exporting trip information in standardized formats.

### Integration Utilities

Helper classes and protocols for seamless app integration.

## Getting Started

TripKitInterApp enables your application to communicate with other transportation and mobility apps:

```swift
import TripKitInterApp
import TripKit

// Configure inter-app communication
// Handle incoming trip data from other applications
// Share trip information with external apps
```

### URL Scheme Integration

Handle incoming trips from other applications through URL schemes:

```swift
// Register URL schemes in your app's Info.plist
// Process incoming trip URLs in your app delegate
```

### Trip Sharing

Share trip information with other compatible applications:

```swift
// Export trip data for sharing
// Handle trip import from external sources
```

## Architecture

TripKitInterApp is designed as a bridge between TripKit's core functionality and external applications. It provides:

- **Standardized Protocols**: Common interfaces for trip data exchange
- **URL Handling**: Robust parsing and generation of trip-related URLs
- **Data Serialization**: Consistent formatting for inter-app data transfer
- **Security**: Safe handling of external data and validation of incoming requests

### Integration Patterns

The framework supports several integration patterns:

- Deep linking for specific trip views
- Bulk trip data sharing
- Real-time trip status updates
- Cross-app user flow continuity

This enables rich ecosystem integration where multiple transportation apps can work together to provide comprehensive mobility solutions.
