// Note: RxSwift public variables causes compilation errors, probably an import issue. Did not resolve this since this means making RxSwift public to the importing project. Used @Published instead
// Note: Just made UNNotificationRequest as output instead of making a Custom Payload object so that in first glance it is recognizable as a Notification.
